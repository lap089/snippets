## dir_list.bsh
- Use BeanShell to write a script to read the directories and files of any directory and output it to a XML file.
- The user is able to input two arguments to the script: any valid path on their system and a path to write the output XML file.
- For example, if the script were to run from the command line:
``` 
 java bsh.Interpreter dir_list.bsh C:/path res.xml
```
